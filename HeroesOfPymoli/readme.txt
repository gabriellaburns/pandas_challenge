Observation 1: the age range 20-24 has the highest Purchase COunt, total Purchase Value, and Avg. Total Purchase per Person. They were the second highest purchase price as well; only 35-39 and <10 had slightly higher average purchase price. 


Observation 2: Men spend the most money on the game and make up the highest percent of players. Marketing it to women could increase sales by increasing the pool of potential purchasers. 

Observation 3: it could be interesting to explore marketing the game to people over 30, who make up less than 20% of the percentage of players. The age range 35-39 has the highest Average Purchase Price, so focusing on increasing that demographic reach could prove profitable for the developers.
